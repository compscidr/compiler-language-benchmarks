# compiler and language benchmarks
Recently started wondering about differences between g++ vs clang/llvm for cpp, and also about the differences between rust and zig vs cpp.

The goal of this repo is to do some benchmark comparisons between the two.

Here are some questions I'd like to answer:
- How long to install the necessary build tools?
- What is the performance like of some repesentative programs?
  - In terms of?
    - running time
    - memory
    - binary size
    - compilation time
  - Hello World
  - Sorting
  - Others?

This is really similar to what already exists here: https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html
