# compiler and language benchmarks
Recently started wondering about differences between g++ vs clang/llvm for cpp, and also about the differences between rust, zig, go vs cpp.

The goal of this repo is to do some benchmark comparisons between them. Probably it will just be a learning project on implementation differences.

Here are some questions I'd like to answer:
- How long to install the necessary build tools?
- What is the performance like of some repesentative programs?
  - In terms of?
    - running time
    - memory
    - binary size
    - compilation time
  - Hello World
  - Sorting
  - Others?

This is really similar to what already exists here: https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html
